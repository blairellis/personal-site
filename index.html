        <h2>I'm the director of product design at <a href="https://mavenclinic.com" target="_blank">Maven Clinic</a>.</h2>
        
        <p>I help teams think big by facilitating cross-functional workshops to bring humans from different disciplines together to dream up the products we'll ship to the humans we design for. I believe product development is a creative craft that requires collaboration, open critical hearts and minds, and hard skills. I love working with people that approach their work with big intentions.</p>
        

        <h3>Things I've learned along the way:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Proper research requires looking at a balance of trends in the broader world, the problems your customers have, and at the nuances in our execution.</li>
            <li>Strategic planning within constraints is one of the hardest parts of building and shipping great, usable products.</li>
            <li>Design is a tool not just for creating beauty and delight, but for fulfilling people's needs.</li>
            <li>The power of storytelling and narrative in conveying the impact the products we build will have on people's lives.</li>
            <li>Clear goals, an agenda, and ensuring everyone in the room can partipate is the key to not wasting people's time. Time is precious.</li>
            <li>Working people and the artifacts we leave behind are what make history.</li>
            <li>Much like parenting, the care and patience that goes into supporting people in their everyday work and careers is limitless.</li>
            <li>Much like social activism, good design is the act of bringing people with a variety of perspectives together to figure out how to make change.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>In a world that often puts short-term profits before the long-term needs of people and the planet, to be a great designer is one of the most radical jobs you can have. Well executed design is good for profits, for people, and for the planet.</h3>
