        <h1>Hello there,</h1>
        
        <h2>I'm Blair. I lead the Experience Team at <a href="https://mavenclinic.com" target="_blank">Maven</a> where we're designing a new system to deliver quality healthcare to women and families. Before Maven I managed the product design team that owned the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank">Etsy</a> buyer experience.</h2>
        
        <p>I believe product development is a creative craft that requires collaboration, open critical hearts and minds, and hard skills. I love working with people that approach their work with big intentions. Some things I've learned along the way:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Proper research requires looking at a balance of trends in the broader world, the problems your customers have, and at the nuances in your execution.</li>
            <li>Strategic planning within constraints is one of the hardest parts of building and shipping great, usable products.</li>
            <li>Design is a tool not just for creating beauty and delight, but for fulfilling people's needs.</li>
            <li>The power of storytelling and narrative in conveying the impact the products we build will have on people's lives.</li>
            <li>Clear goals, an agenda, and ensuring everyone in the room can partipate is the key to not wasting people's time. Time is precious.</li>
            <li>Active listening and trust is required to support people in their everyday work and longer term careers.</li>
            <li>Good design is the act of bringing people with a variety of perspectives together to figure out how to make change.</li>
            <li>Working people and the artifacts we leave behind are what make history.</li>
        </ul>
